                        <br />
                        <p>ABSTRACT：</p>

                        <p>
                            Fusion of technologies starts with interdisciplinarity which draws knowledge from different fields and creates new areas by working across boundaries. Product development is becoming exceedingly complex and innovative products require unrelated technologies combined in new ways.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This talk begins with an introduction of STEM education and interdisciplinary learning. As teaching and research are the yin and the yang of successful universities, it is important to understand the teaching-research connections. If you have teaching without research, you risk of not creating new knowledge. If you have research without teaching, you risk of imparting past knowledge. So, what are the new skill sets and attributes in preparing young people to excel and succeed in the 21st century? To answer this question, a new education model in a new era is proposed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In addition, the fourth industrial revolution will change the world dramatically. The impact will be far greater than its three predecessors. Specifically, many existing PMET (Professional, Manager, Executive and Technician) jobs as well as traditional universities, technologies and industries will disappear. Together with the pandemic, they will accelerate the pace of digital transformation as well as create new job opportunities and growth areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, this talk will present new research areas. These exciting transformations will change how we think about research collaborations. It will also change the nature and direction of our research. What are the challenges of modern education? What are the next big things? How is it going to affect us? This talk will attempt to answer these questions.

                        <br />
                        <p>ABSTRACT：</p>
                        <p>
                            The fusion of digital and real worlds in all dimensions will be the driving force for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems. Ubiquitous in-time and on-time communication services between humans, machines, robots, and their virtual counterparts are essential, and they expand from the ground to air, space, underground, and deep sea. 6G systems are not only data pipelines but also large-scale distributed computing systems with integrated sensing, processing, storage, communication and computing capabilities. It is challenging to build ubiquitous and intelligent 6G systems, handling stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements, providing a rich set of communication modes, including unicast, multicast, broadcast, in-cast, and group-cast, and supporting user-centric mobile applications. In this talk, we introduce a new protocol architecture, Self-Evolving and Transformative (SET) architecture that can provide a wide range of control functions, and be intelligently configured for different types of 6G applications and networking environments. Its design principles, potentials, and open issues are discussed. We also introduce a use case applying the architecture to develop a mobility-aware multi-path QUIC protocol for satellite networks.

                        <h3>KEYNOTE: A Knife Cuts Both Ways –Attacks and Defenses of Deep Neural Networks</h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>ABSTRACT：</p>
                        <p>
                            The flourishing Internet of Things (IoT) has rekindled on-premises computing to allow data to be analyzed closer to the source. Neural architecture search, open-source deep neural network (DNN) model compilers and commercially available toolkits have evolved to facilitate rapid development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. This “model once, run optimized anywhere” paradigm shift in deep learning computations introduces new attack surfaces and threat models that are methodologically different from existing software-based attacks. Model integrity is a primary pillar for AI trust to ensure that the system delivers and maintains the desirable quality of service and are free from unauthorized deliberate or inadvertent manipulation of the system throughout the lifetime of their deployment. A superior and well-trained DNN classifier is not only an intellectual property (IP) of high market value but also consists of private and sensitive information. Unfortunately, existing DNN hardware implementations mainly focus on throughput and energy efficiency optimization, which can unintentionally introduce exploitable vulnerabilities. The situation is aggravated by the trend of outsourcing model training, renting cloud computing platforms, and deploying partially or fully trained third-party models for AI application development and edge inference. This talk will present some of our research works on the attacks and defenses of DNNs.

                        <br />
                        <p>ABSTRACT：</p>
                        <p>
                            Electromagnetics in medicine has played a crucial role in early diagnosis, long-term monitoring and medical treatment. Numerous applications in medical diagnostics and therapeutics ranging from cardiac pacemakers to emerging devices in visual prosthesis, brain computer interfaces and body area networks have spurred electronic engineers to propose new wireless medical devices. Wireless implantable medical devices (IMDs) provide an opportunity to improve the patient health monitoring and treatment. To extend the lifespan without incorporating a bulky battery and to facilitate the miniaturization of IMDs, the wireless power transfer (WPT) technology and antenna miniaturization and multifunction have played an essential role. On the other hand, smart wireless sensing has increasingly been adopted in medical applications for monitoring, detecting and tracking of medical condition developments. In this presentation, solutions and developments on WPT, antenna and wireless sensing for biomedical applications will be presented.

                        </h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>ABSTRACT：</p>
                        <p>As indicated by Professor John L. Hennessy (Former President of Stanford University), “High-technology companies are both an important part of our world’s economic growth story as well as the place where many young entrepreneurs realize their dreams”.</p>
                        <p>Starting from an old photo which was taken over around 1982, the speaker will first share his own story on how and why to develop the world’s first prototype of “Touch Phone (1982)”, with audiences. He will then couple his R&D experiences of over 36 years in the US industry and 10 years in academia across the world with his global touch and involvements with several startups. This talk will blend technology, liberal art, creativity, innovation, business and management together to guide the audiences to go through an interdisciplinary process from “Curiosity > Opportunity> Business Model> Risk Management> Technology Commercialization and Business Innovation”. A Case study will be also discussed. At the end of this talk, the speaker hopes that the audiences will have a first-hand feeling to understand how technologist and entrepreneur transfer their curiosity, hard work, and ambition at the very early stage into decisive actions of establishing their own enterprise, and then eventually expand it to one of the top Fortunate 500 corporations in the world.</p>
                        <p>
                            In the meantime, the creation of academic spin-offs from universities research labs and research institutes are now playing a key mechanism of the technology commercialization for IPRs-based research prototypes. University spin-offs are now starting to play a critical role for economic development, Commercializing university technologies and also helping university with their major missions of research and teaching.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Based on speaker’s own experiences as corporate technical staff, director and executive director for 26 years and then visiting professor (since 2012); Hopefully this talk might be able to stimulate audience’s entrepreneurial spirit, and ultimately encourage some of faculty members and students to make their dreams of having their own Technology Start-Ups through Academic Spin-offs.

                            KEYNOTE： Machine Learning for Optimized Use of Network Resources

                        <p>ABSTRACT：</p>
                        <p>
                            Optimization techniques are widely used to allocate limited resources in communication networks.  The speaker will start by showing the well-known Transport Control Protocol (TCP) as a distributed solution to achieve the optimal bandwidth allocation. Unfortunately, factors such as multiple grades of service, variable transmission power, and tradeoffs between communication and computation often make the optimization problem for resource allocation non-convex. New distributed solutions are needed to solve these problems.

                        </p>
                        <p>As an example, the speaker will consider in-network data processing in sensor networks where data are aggregated along the way as they are transferred toward the end user.  Finding the optimal solution is NP-hard, but for specific settings, the problem can lead to a distributed framework for achieving the optimal tradeoff between communications and computation costs.</p>
                        <p>
                            For the afore-mentioned problems, gradient-based iterative algorithms are commonly used as a solution technique. Much research focuses on improving the iteration convergence. However, when the system parameters change, it requires a new solution from the iterative methods. The speaker will present a new machine-learning method by using two Coupled Long Short-Term Memory (CLSTM) networks to quickly and robustly produce the optimal or near-optimal solutions to non-convex, constrained optimization problems over a range of system parameters. Numerical examples for allocation of network resources will be presented to confirm the validity of the proposed method.

                            The fundamental elements MOS switch, capacitor and inductor (transformer) are revitalized for their potentials to passive-ize the critical RF and analog functions of the wireless radios, aiming to alleviate the obvious tradeoff between the noise, linearity and power consumption. Imagine a low-noise amplifier (LNA) using no transconductance (gm) can be highly linear, while the voltage gain, input-impedance matching and noise figure (NF) are the metrics to innovate. We demonstrate how a Bluetooth LE receiver using no gm can achieve high linearity, and high RF-to-baseband gain (>30dB) to suppress the noise effect of the subsequent circuitry, yielding an outstanding SFDR of 77dB at a sub-300µW power budget. These examples pace the way to build a greener world of energy-autonomous wireless radios for the Internet-of-Everything (IoE) era.

                            Microwave and Millimeter-wave switches are key components in communication systems. They are used for signal routing and for realizing a wide range of reconfigurable microwave and millimeter-wave devices.  Phase Change Materials (PCM) have been widely used in optical storage media and non-volatile memory device applications. Over the past recent years, there have been interest in exploiting the PCM materials such as germanium telluride (GeTe) and metal insulator transition materials such as vanadium oxides (VO2) for RF applications. The principle of operation of PCM devices is based on the ability of the material to transform from a high-resistivity state (amorphous phase) to a low-resistivity state (crystalline phase) and vice versa with the application of short duration pulses.  Several orders of magnitude in resistivity change can be achieved by PCM technology allowing the realization of highly miniature microwave and millimeter-wave switches.  In addition to miniaturization, GeTe based switches offer latching functionality and ease of monolithic integration with other RF circuits. This talk will address recent developments in PCM switches and their applications to the realization of   reconfigurable filters, switch matrices, phase shifters, variable attenuators, and reflective intelligent surfaces. It outlines major design considerations for tunable filters presenting techniques to realize tunable filters that maintain filter performance over tuning range, illustrating examples of tunable filters tuned only a by single tuning element. The talk also addresses existing tuning technologies, providing a comparison between Semiconductor, MEMS and PCM tuning elements in terms of linearity, insertion loss, suitability for use at millimeter-wave frequencies and ease of integration with high-Q filters. Very recent results for PCM-based reconfigurable acoustic filters are also presented.

                            China imported in the recent past more “sand” than oil, meaning silicon transformed into electronic chips, quite crucial in a moment where the quest is no longer for energy (oil), as in the past, but for computing power (silicon). The national high demand for state-of-the-art integrated circuits is driving research and development in the run after a Chinese CPU (Electronics Brain). Besides the Brain, all Electronics needs its Senses that are at the core of the Analog/Digital Interface with Audio, Vision & Sensors, essential for the Internet of Everything – IoE, because a brain does not work without a sensing system. University of Macau (UM) and its State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI are prominent and now renowned for its excellence and expertise in the design of innovative circuits for the analog/digital interface, contributing to address also A/D Interface Independency. In a recent book entitled “Analog and Mixed-Signal Circuits in Nanoscale CMOS” we presented the most critical building blocks of such interface that are high-performance radios, power-efficient RF and mm-Wave circuits, ultra-low-voltage clock references, low power and high-performance data converters, integrated energy harvesting interfaces, fully integrated power converters and low-dropout regulators. All these circuits need to exhibit high quality performance with low power consumption, high energy-efficiency and high speed, thus enabling a reliable and consistent development of the IoE while enlarging its frontiers. There is a huge pressure in the design area with a high demand for analog design engineers, opening a vast field of opportunities and challenges that imply a continuous knowledge update. Then, UM is contributing to stimulate and well-equip the mind of future skillful analog design engineers in state-of-the-art designs adequate for most applications.

                            Driven by the evolution of commercial applications and user experience, the demand of 5G/6G high-speed communication is increasing rapidly in recent years. Data transmission in millimeter-wave (mm-wave) and subterahertz (sub-THz) is gaining interest to provide widely available bandwidth and meet the requirement for higher capacity and lower latency. Interconnects with low power loss and good signal integrity are necessary for 5G/6G communication network. Among all competitors, air-filled interconnect may play an essential role for 5G/6G applications. Air-filled substrate integrated waveguide (AFSIW) offers an extremely low-loss solution for inner-board transmission. And air-filled dielectric waveguide (AFDW) provides a low-loss solution for intra-device transmission with short-to-medium distance. Moreover, highly-integrated multi-lane AFDWs are expected to achieve communication with even higher throughput. However, the interference issue is critical. To enhance signal integrity of multi-lane AFDW, photonic crystal fence (PCF) can be applied compactly with AFDWs and provide significant crosstalk reduction. These techniques take a key step for the technical race in the 5G/6G high-speed communication in the near future.

                        <p>
                            We propose a new wave-based computing architecture called stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) to enable joint computing and communication in electro-magnetic (EM) domain. An SIM is fabricated by stacking an array of programmable metasurface layers, where each layer consists of many low-cost passive meta-atoms that can individually manipulate EM waves. By appropriately configuring the passive meta-atoms, an SIM can automatically accomplish advanced computation tasks as the EM wave propagates through it, while reducing both the energy consumption and processing delay. In this talk, we will illustrate the application of SIM in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multi-user MIMO wireless communications.
