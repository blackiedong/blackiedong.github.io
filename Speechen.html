                        <br />
                        <p>ABSTRACT：</p>
                        <p>
                            The flourishing Internet of Things (IoT) has rekindled on-premises computing to allow data to be analyzed closer to the source. Neural architecture search, open-source deep neural network (DNN) model compilers and commercially available toolkits have evolved to facilitate rapid development and deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. This “model once, run optimized anywhere” paradigm shift in deep learning computations introduces new attack surfaces and threat models that are methodologically different from existing software-based attacks. Model integrity is a primary pillar for AI trust to ensure that the system delivers and maintains the desirable quality of service and are free from unauthorized deliberate or inadvertent manipulation of the system throughout the lifetime of their deployment. A superior and well-trained DNN classifier is not only an intellectual property (IP) of high market value but also consists of private and sensitive information. Unfortunately, existing DNN hardware implementations mainly focus on throughput and energy efficiency optimization, which can unintentionally introduce exploitable vulnerabilities. The situation is aggravated by the trend of outsourcing model training, renting cloud computing platforms, and deploying partially or fully trained third-party models for AI application development and edge inference. This talk will present some of our research works on the attacks and defenses of DNNs.

                        <h3>KEYNOTE: Electromagnetics in Medicine: Current Status and Challenges of Wireless Power Transfer, Antennas and Wireless Sensing</h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>ABSTRACT：</p>
                        <p>
                            Electromagnetics in medicine has played a crucial role in early diagnosis, long-term monitoring and medical treatment. Numerous applications in medical diagnostics and therapeutics ranging from cardiac pacemakers to emerging devices in visual prosthesis, brain computer interfaces and body area networks have spurred electronic engineers to propose new wireless medical devices. Wireless implantable medical devices (IMDs) provide an opportunity to improve the patient health monitoring and treatment. To extend the lifespan without incorporating a bulky battery and to facilitate the miniaturization of IMDs, the wireless power transfer (WPT) technology and antenna miniaturization and multifunction have played an essential role. On the other hand, smart wireless sensing has increasingly been adopted in medical applications for monitoring, detecting and tracking of medical condition developments. In this presentation, solutions and developments on WPT, antenna and wireless sensing for biomedical applications will be presented.

                            KEYNOTE: Where Technologist and Entrepreneur Meet to Stimulate Academic Spin-Offs
                        </h3>
                        <br />
                        <p>ABSTRACT：</p>
                        <p>As indicated by Professor John L. Hennessy (Former President of Stanford University), “High-technology companies are both an important part of our world’s economic growth story as well as the place where many young entrepreneurs realize their dreams”.</p>
                        <p>Starting from an old photo which was taken over around 1982, the speaker will first share his own story on how and why to develop the world’s first prototype of “Touch Phone (1982)”, with audiences. He will then couple his R&D experiences of over 36 years in the US industry and 10 years in academia across the world with his global touch and involvements with several startups. This talk will blend technology, liberal art, creativity, innovation, business and management together to guide the audiences to go through an interdisciplinary process from “Curiosity > Opportunity> Business Model> Risk Management> Technology Commercialization and Business Innovation”. A Case study will be also discussed. At the end of this talk, the speaker hopes that the audiences will have a first-hand feeling to understand how technologist and entrepreneur transfer their curiosity, hard work, and ambition at the very early stage into decisive actions of establishing their own enterprise, and then eventually expand it to one of the top Fortunate 500 corporations in the world.</p>
                        <p>
                            In the meantime, the creation of academic spin-offs from universities research labs and research institutes are now playing a key mechanism of the technology commercialization for IPRs-based research prototypes. University spin-offs are now starting to play a critical role for economic development, Commercializing university technologies and also helping university with their major missions of research and teaching.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Based on speaker’s own experiences as corporate technical staff, director and executive director for 26 years and then visiting professor (since 2012); Hopefully this talk might be able to stimulate audience’s entrepreneurial spirit, and ultimately encourage some of faculty members and students to make their dreams of having their own Technology Start-Ups through Academic Spin-offs.

                        <p>ABSTRACT：</p>
                        <p>
                            Microwave and Millimeter-wave switches are key components in communication systems. They are used for signal routing and for realizing a wide range of reconfigurable microwave and millimeter-wave devices.  Phase Change Materials (PCM) have been widely used in optical storage media and non-volatile memory device applications. Over the past recent years, there have been interest in exploiting the PCM materials such as germanium telluride (GeTe) and metal insulator transition materials such as vanadium oxides (VO2) for RF applications. The principle of operation of PCM devices is based on the ability of the material to transform from a high-resistivity state (amorphous phase) to a low-resistivity state (crystalline phase) and vice versa with the application of short duration pulses.  Several orders of magnitude in resistivity change can be achieved by PCM technology allowing the realization of highly miniature microwave and millimeter-wave switches.  In addition to miniaturization, GeTe based switches offer latching functionality and ease of monolithic integration with other RF circuits. This talk will address recent developments in PCM switches and their applications to the realization of   reconfigurable filters, switch matrices, phase shifters, variable attenuators, and reflective intelligent surfaces. It outlines major design considerations for tunable filters presenting techniques to realize tunable filters that maintain filter performance over tuning range, illustrating examples of tunable filters tuned only a by single tuning element. The talk also addresses existing tuning technologies, providing a comparison between Semiconductor, MEMS and PCM tuning elements in terms of linearity, insertion loss, suitability for use at millimeter-wave frequencies and ease of integration with high-Q filters. Very recent results for PCM-based reconfigurable acoustic filters are also presented.

                        <p>
                            Driven by the evolution of commercial applications and user experience, the demand of 5G/6G high-speed communication is increasing rapidly in recent years. Data transmission in millimeter-wave (mm-wave) and subterahertz (sub-THz) is gaining interest to provide widely available bandwidth and meet the requirement for higher capacity and lower latency. Interconnects with low power loss and good signal integrity are necessary for 5G/6G communication network. Among all competitors, air-filled interconnect may play an essential role for 5G/6G applications. Air-filled substrate integrated waveguide (AFSIW) offers an extremely low-loss solution for inner-board transmission. And air-filled dielectric waveguide (AFDW) provides a low-loss solution for intra-device transmission with short-to-medium distance. Moreover, highly-integrated multi-lane AFDWs are expected to achieve communication with even higher throughput. However, the interference issue is critical. To enhance signal integrity of multi-lane AFDW, photonic crystal fence (PCF) can be applied compactly with AFDWs and provide significant crosstalk reduction. These techniques take a key step for the technical race in the 5G/6G high-speed communication in the near future.
