        <h4></h4>
        <h4><strong>Interdisciplinarity</strong> draws knowledge from different fields and creates new areas by working across boundaries. Product development is becoming exceedingly complex and innovative products require unrelated technologies combined in new ways.</h4>
        <h4>The semiconductor industry has long been a leader in connecting things in the factory while the communication industry has always been a front-runner in connecting people in our daily lives. They are at the heart of technology innovation.</h4>
        <h4>Nowadays, people are not just accessing digital information in real time but also watching movies, playing games, and enjoying multimedia data streaming services even in airplanes and trains traveling at very high speeds. As society evolves towards a more data- and network-oriented world, consumers and service providers are seeking more advanced communication systems that offer lower latency, higher bandwidth, and larger data capacity. Silicon-based technologies are still the best candidates for future communication system because they offer very-large-scale integration and low-cost mass production. Additionally, advances in materials engineering have pushed the maximum operating frequencies of silicon-CMOS and silicon germanium devices to more than 500 GHz. </h4>
        <h4>Hence, efforts are underway to consider beyond state-of-the-art protocols, future chip design and integration, and even standardization of 6G wireless communication systems. Therefore, the next generation of wireless communication and semiconductor technology is expected to meet the demands of various challenging use cases that cover a wide range of new applications from 5G/6G communications, mobile computing, artificial intelligence, and advanced internet of things to big data, cloud, and edge computing.  </h4>
        <h4>
            This international conference will be open to enterprises and experts in the field of semiconductor and integrated circuit, aiming to provide a professional multi-disciplinary and multi-field exchange and cooperation platform for enterprises, universities and research institutes in the field of semiconductor and integrated circuit, provide innovative ideas for the increasingly complex and difficult product development, and combine cutting-edge scientific research and product innovation more effectively. At the same time for more in-depth cooperation between schools and enterprises to lay a solid foundation.
