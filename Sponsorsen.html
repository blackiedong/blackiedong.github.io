                            Through strength, persistence, and adaptability, Realtek follows in the spirit of the crab.<br />
                            From establishment in 1987 by seven skilled and committed engineers, through several years of tough times, to today's success as a premier IC design house, Realtek has overcome numerous challenges to achieve consistent growth. We value our ability to foresee market trends and demands and to commit ourselves to technological innovation to meet those demands.<br />
                            We have positioned ourselves as designers and distributors of IC products developed through extensive research into market and customer needs. We recognize that the key to our success is in the value we provide to new technologies, products, applications, and markets.<br />
                            Employees are Realtek's most important asset, and as the pillars of a culture of confidence and trust, are recognized as the key to our success. Growing and optimistic individuals have demonstrated a positive impact on the company's growth.<br />
                            Realtek employees are empowered with authority and given freedom to make decisions to determine the best methods to approach issues. Employees are encouraged to develop freely and work autonomously, and are evaluated on ability and performance, under healthy and fair competition standards, allowing each individual to progress and achieve advanced corporate and personal goals. This philosophy has created a strong common identity and cohesiveness throughout Realtek, benefiting the pursuit of corporate success.<br />
                            In line with the Realtek culture of "Self-confidence and trust in people", we believe that we can achieve our best, and trust our colleagues can also do the same. Working and learning in Realtek, we openly share knowledge and experience with one another to inspire innovation and pursue growth of the company, as well the individuals.<br />
