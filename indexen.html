                            The School of Microelectronics, Tianjin University, is one of the 26 national exemplary Schools of Microelectronics. It was founded in September 2015 based on School of Electronic and Information Engineering. On 11th November 2016, it became an independent school with 52 staff, including 14 professors, 16 associate professors and 7 lecturers. 48 staff are master tutors, and 28 staff are doctor tutor. There more than 800 undergraduate and graduate students. The school’s atmosphere is rigorous and alive. We cultivate students' international vision and cross-cultural communication skills by bilingual education, 3+1 years international cooperate educating and joint school with Georgia Institute of Technology. Our students have performed well in various technology, culture and sports competitions such as Champion of international microwave conference student design contest modelling project; Special prize of Tianjin innovation and entrepreneurship scholarship; The special prize of “Bao Gang” scholarship; National Champion and international third place of the China-UK business plan competition; and First prize of China university bio-networking entrepreneurship competition.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every year, over 55% graduates get offer to study on in both national and international reputable university. The employment rate of graduates is about 98%. Most graduates have job offers from leading companies such as China aerospace science and industry group, China aerospace science and technology group, China electronics technology group strategic key units, China mobile, China unicom, ZTE, Huawei, Purple light show sharp, HiSilicon semiconductors, Grace wisdom pu, Unigroup, NXP Semiconductor, SMIC, Beijing Orient science and technology, etc.
